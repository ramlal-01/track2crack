# DSA Sheet Component Refactoring

## Overview
The original `DSASheet.jsx` file (950+ lines) has been refactored into smaller, reusable components to improve maintainability, readability, and mobile responsiveness.

## Component Structure

### Main Component
- **DSASheet.jsx** - Main container component that orchestrates all child components

### Child Components
1. **ProgressCircles.jsx** - Displays circular progress bars for Easy, Medium, Hard, and Overall completion
2. **FilterTabs.jsx** - Handles filtering by status (All, Solved, Bookmarked, Reminders) and difficulty
3. **SearchBar.jsx** - Provides search functionality for questions
4. **TopicSection.jsx** - Renders each topic section with collapsible functionality
5. **QuestionRow.jsx** - Individual question row with all actions (complete, bookmark, remind, note)
6. **ReminderModal.jsx** - Modal for setting/clearing reminders
7. **NoteModal.jsx** - Modal for adding/editing notes

## Mobile Responsiveness Improvements

### Responsive Design Features
- **Adaptive Layout**: Components automatically adjust for different screen sizes
- **Mobile-First Approach**: Designed with mobile devices as the primary target
- **Touch-Friendly**: Larger touch targets and improved spacing on mobile
- **Flexible Grid**: Uses CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive layouts

### Breakpoints Used
- **sm**: 640px and up
- **md**: 768px and up  
- **lg**: 1024px and up
- **xl**: 1280px and up

### Mobile-Specific Changes

#### Header Section
- Progress circles stack vertically on mobile
- Title and subtitle center-aligned on small screens
- Responsive text sizes (2xl → 3xl → 4xl)

#### Filter Tabs
- Wrap to multiple lines on small screens
- Smaller padding and text on mobile
- Dropdown moves below tabs on narrow screens

#### Search Bar
- Full width with proper mobile padding
- Larger touch targets for clear button

#### Topic Sections
- Collapsible design saves vertical space
- Progress bars adjust width based on screen size
- Reset buttons with appropriate mobile sizing

#### Question Rows
- **Desktop**: Traditional table layout with columns
- **Mobile**: Card-based layout with stacked information
- Actions grouped logically for better mobile UX
- Larger touch targets for buttons and checkboxes

## Props Structure

### DSASheet (Main Component)
No props - manages all state internally

### ProgressCircles
```jsx
{
  easyProgress, mediumProgress, hardProgress, progress,
  easyCompleted, easyQuestions, mediumCompleted, mediumQuestions,
  hardCompleted, hardQuestions, completed, total,
  darkMode, darkText
}
```

### FilterTabs
```jsx
{
  filter, setFilter, difficultyFilter, setDifficultyFilter,
  setSearchQuery, darkMode
}
```

### SearchBar
```jsx
{
  searchQuery, setSearchQuery, darkMode, darkInput
}
```

### TopicSection
```jsx
{
  topic, questions, expandedTopics, setExpandedTopics,
  animatedWidths, progressMap, handleToggle, setOpenReminderId,
  setOpenNoteId, openReminderId, openNoteId, noteText, setNoteText,
  updateProgress, setProgressMap, handleReminderChange,
  handleResetTopic, resettingTopic, darkMode, darkCardBg,
  darkBorder, darkText, darkTableHeader, darkTableRow, darkInput
}
```

### QuestionRow
```jsx
{
  question, progress, handleToggle, setOpenReminderId, setOpenNoteId,
  openReminderId, openNoteId, noteText, setNoteText, progressMap,
  updateProgress, setProgressMap, handleReminderChange, darkMode,
  darkTableRow, darkInput
}
```

## Benefits of Refactoring

### 1. **Maintainability**
- Each component has a single responsibility
- Easier to debug and modify specific features
- Clear separation of concerns

### 2. **Reusability**
- Components can be reused in other parts of the application
- Consistent UI patterns across the app

### 3. **Mobile Responsiveness**
- Dedicated mobile layouts for better UX
- Touch-friendly interactions
- Optimized for various screen sizes

### 4. **Performance**
- Smaller bundle sizes for individual components
- Better tree-shaking opportunities
- Reduced re-renders with proper prop passing

### 5. **Developer Experience**
- Easier to understand and modify
- Better code organization
- Improved debugging capabilities

## Usage Example

```jsx
import DSASheet from './pages/DSASheet';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <DSASheet />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Dark Mode Support
All components support dark mode through the `useTheme` context and include appropriate dark mode classes for:
- Background colors
- Text colors
- Border colors
- Hover states
- Input fields

## Migration Notes
- Original file backed up as `DSASheet_backup.jsx`
- All functionality preserved
- API calls and state management unchanged
- Improved error handling and loading states
