# DSA Sheet Table View Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Auto-Closing Table Problem**
**Issue**: Table sections were automatically closing when clicking inside them.

**Root Cause**: The click outside handler was too aggressive and wasn't properly detecting clicks inside table elements.

**Fix**: 
- Improved the `handleClickOutside` function in `DSASheet.jsx`
- Added proper ref handling for topic sections via `topicRefs`
- Enhanced detection of clicks inside modals, dropdowns, and form elements
- Added checks for search input and other interactive elements

```javascript
// Before: Basic click detection
if (!clickedInsideAnyTopic && !clickedInsideControls) {
  setExpandedTopics({});
}

// After: Comprehensive click detection
if (!clickedInsideAnyTopic && !clickedInsideControls && 
    !clickedInsideReminder && !clickedInsideNote && 
    !openReminderId && !openNoteId) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    setExpandedTopics({});
  }, 100);
}
```

### 2. **Links Not Visible/Clickable**
**Issue**: Platform links (LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks) were not visible or clickable in the table.

**Root Cause**: Grid layout issues and missing click event handling.

**Fix**:
- Adjusted grid column spans for better space allocation
- Added `onClick={(e) => e.stopPropagation()}` to prevent event bubbling
- Enhanced link styling with proper hover states and transitions
- Improved responsive design for link visibility

```javascript
// Added proper event handling
<a
  href={question.leetcodeLink}
  target="_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer"
  className="text-orange-500 hover:text-orange-600 text-lg transition-colors"
  title="LeetCode"
  onClick={(e) => e.stopPropagation()} // Prevents table row click
>
  <SiLeetcode />
</a>
```

### 3. **Table Structure Issues**
**Issue**: Table layout was disturbed and columns were misaligned.

**Root Cause**: Inconsistent grid structure between header and rows.

**Fix**:
- Standardized grid layout with consistent column spans
- Updated table header structure in `TopicSection.jsx`
- Improved responsive grid system for desktop vs mobile
- Fixed column alignment and spacing

```javascript
// Before: Inconsistent grid
<div className="hidden md:grid md:grid-cols-12 gap-4">
  <div className="col-span-5 lg:col-span-6">Question</div>
  // Inconsistent spans
</div>

// After: Consistent grid
<div className="grid grid-cols-12 gap-2 items-center p-4">
  <div className="col-span-4">Question</div>
  <div className="col-span-2 text-center">Links</div>
  // Consistent and logical spans
</div>
```

### 4. **Click Event Propagation**
**Issue**: Clicking on interactive elements was triggering parent element events.

**Root Cause**: Missing event.stopPropagation() calls on interactive elements.

**Fix**:
- Added `e.stopPropagation()` to all interactive elements
- Prevented checkbox, button, and link clicks from bubbling up
- Improved event handling for modals and dropdowns

```javascript
// Added to all interactive elements
onClick={(e) => {
  e.stopPropagation();
  // Handle the specific action
}}
```

### 5. **Ref Management**
**Issue**: Topic refs were not properly set up, causing click detection issues.

**Root Cause**: Missing topicRefs prop and improper ref assignment.

**Fix**:
- Added `topicRefs` prop to `TopicSection` component
- Proper ref assignment in topic containers
- Updated main component to pass refs correctly

```javascript
// Added proper ref handling
<div 
  ref={(el) => {
    if (topicRefs && topicRefs.current) {
      topicRefs.current[topic] = el;
    }
  }}
  className={`${darkCardBg} ${darkBorder} border rounded-lg mb-6`}
>
```

## Testing Checklist

To verify all fixes are working:

1. **Table Interaction**
   - [ ] Click inside table rows - should not close the section
   - [ ] Click on checkboxes - should toggle without closing section
   - [ ] Click on bookmark buttons - should work without side effects

2. **Links**
   - [ ] LeetCode links should be visible and clickable
   - [ ] GeeksforGeeks links should be visible and clickable
   - [ ] Links should open in new tabs

3. **Modals and Dropdowns**
   - [ ] Reminder modal should open/close properly
   - [ ] Note modal should open/close properly
   - [ ] Clicking inside modals should not close the table section

4. **Responsive Design**
   - [ ] Test on mobile devices
   - [ ] Test on tablet sizes
   - [ ] Test on desktop

5. **General Functionality**
   - [ ] All original features should work as expected
   - [ ] No console errors
   - [ ] Smooth animations and transitions

## Files Modified

1. `TopicSection.jsx` - Fixed table structure and ref handling
2. `QuestionRow.jsx` - Fixed event handling and grid layout
3. `DSASheet.jsx` - Improved click outside detection and ref management

## Performance Impact

- ✅ No negative impact on performance
- ✅ Better event handling reduces unnecessary re-renders
